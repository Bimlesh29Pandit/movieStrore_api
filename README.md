# movieStore_api

<h3>Statement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Take help from IMDB and create entire Movie store api in express + mongoose</li>
    <li>The objective is to support all 4 CRUD operation, but specifically multiple types of get operations</li>
    <li>Endpoints should be decided by yourself</li>
    <li> For get requests on list of movies, we need to have multiple filtering criteria supported</li>
    <ul>
        <li>filter by title</li>
        <li>filter by rating</li>
        <li>search a movie by name. eg. if we make query like /movies?q=dho, All movies that have Dho should returned: Dhoom, Dhoni: Untold Story etc.</li>
<li>sortBy queryParam, which will sort by a field.</li></ul></ul>
